This simple, ultra-light batch script that's open sourced helps you quickly test basic network connectivity. It runs on any Windows machine without the need for additional tools or installation. This script performs the basic networking commands such as pinging a website, tracing the route to a server, and confirming DNS resolution; pretty straightforward stuff. It is meant for quick troubleshooting, especially to verify if the network (internet or internal) is fine. Due to its small size, you can keep it on a USB pen drive or a shared folder, ever ready to be pulled out for quick network troubleshooting.
